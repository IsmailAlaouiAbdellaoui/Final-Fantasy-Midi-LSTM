# Generation of Final Fantasy Midi songs using LSTMs and GRUs

Notebooks based on the code from the following repository: https://github.com/brannondorsey/midi-rnn

These notebooks have been adapted to use Tensorflow 2

The songs used are battle/fight songs from FF series. They include songs from FF1 untill FF8.

It is advised to use these notebooks on Google colab since RNNs in general take some time to process forward and back-propagation.
